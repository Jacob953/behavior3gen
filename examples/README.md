# Example of Behavior3Gen

Additional examples will be provided as new features are introduced.

## Build

It is recommended to register all nodes with field.NewXXX in a centralized map, similar to how register.go does it.

## Run

Execute the following command:

``` bash
go run main.go
```

The generated content will be output to Stdout. Additionally, a new file, config/node.b3, will be created.
